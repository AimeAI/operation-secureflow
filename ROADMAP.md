# 🗺️ Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (Current)
*   [x] Define Project Objectives.
*   [x] Develop One-Shot Proof of Concept (PoC).
*   [ ] Assess existing network infrastructure limitations.
*   [ ] Define WAM (World-Class Alignment Metrics) with PEO Digital.

## Phase 2: Development & Testing
*   [ ] Connect Python dashboard to live network logs (Syslog/Splunk).
*   [ ] Train AI models on historical naval network data.
*   [ ] Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for security.
*   [ ] Conduct Red Team/Blue Team simulation exercises.

## Phase 3: Deployment & Training
*   [ ] Deploy SecureFlow to pilot unit (e.g., one DDG or Shore Command).
*   [ ] Conduct IT personnel training.
*   [ ] Collect feedback to refine UI/UX.

## Phase 4: Maintenance & Support
*   [ ] Continuous model retraining.
*   [ ] Expansion to fleet-wide deployment.
*   [ ] Integration of classified/secret level data handling (SIPRNet).

## Future Enhancements
*   **Mobile App:** Extend SecureFlow to iOS/Android for on-the-go monitoring
*   **Edge Computing:** Deploy lightweight versions on ship servers for offline operation
*   **Advanced ML:** Implement deep learning models (LSTM, Transformers) for better predictions
*   **Integration Hub:** Connect with existing Navy systems (NMCI, CANES, ISNS)

## Success Metrics
*   Reduce mean time to detect (MTTD) security incidents by 40%
*   Decrease help desk ticket resolution time by 50%
*   Achieve 100% compliance audit pass rate
*   Maintain 99.9% system uptime
