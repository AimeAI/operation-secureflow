## 📋 Project Overview
**Operation SecureFlow** is a modernized IT management platform designed for the Navy and Marine Corps. It leverages Artificial Intelligence to ensure essential services remain operational and secure, reducing downtime and providing actionable insights for IT personnel.

### 🎯 Core Objectives
*   **Enhance Security:** Proactive threat detection via Machine Learning.
*   **Optimize Performance:** Predictive analytics to minimize latency.
*   **Automate Compliance:** DoD-aligned automated auditing.
*   **Improve UX:** Streamlined IT service portal for Sailors and Marines.

## 🛠 Key Capabilities
1.  **🛡️ AI Security Monitor:** Real-time anomaly detection (Isolation Forest) for network traffic.
2.  **📊 Performance Analytics:** Predictive modeling for system load and health.
3.  **✅ Compliance Engine:** Automated checking against DoD 8500.01 & NIST standards.
4.  **🤖 Service Portal:** AI-assisted Help Desk for rapid issue resolution.

## 🚀 Quick Start
To run the pilot demonstration locally:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Launch the Dashboard:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run secureflow_demo.py
    ```

## 📅 Pilot Plan
This project is currently in **Phase 1 (Discovery & Planning)**. The codebase represents a "One Shot" Proof of Concept (PoC) to validate World-Class Alignment Metrics (WAM) with PEO Digital.
